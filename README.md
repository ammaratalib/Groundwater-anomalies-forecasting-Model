Monitoring anomalies in groundwater (GW) over long periods of time is also essential to understanding water resource variability. However, it is challenging to predict GW anomalies over the long term in agricultural areas due to complicated boundary conditions, heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, groundwater extraction, and nonlinear interactions among these factors. To overcome this challenge, I developed an advanced modeling framework based on a recurrent neural network of long short-term memory (LSTM) as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. The objective of my study was to forecast GW anomalies two months in advance and to evaluate the drivers that influence GW dynamics in densely irrigated agricultural regions. The modeling framework was developed by utilizing dynamic and static variables from satellite products to represent hydrometeorological and geological characteristics (Talib et al., 2024b). My modeling framework can be used as an alternative method of simulating water availability and groundwater level changes in areas where subsurface properties are unknown or difficult to determine. This research informs adaptive management strategies to help maximize and sustain ecosystem and landscape integrity, function, and resilience.
